# quickstart-datalake-47lining
## Data Lake Foundation on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys a data lake foundation that integrates Amazon Web Services (AWS) services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Athena, Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES), and Amazon QuickSight.

The data lake foundation uses these AWS services to provide data submission, ingest processing, dataset management, data transformation, aggregation, and analysis, search, publishing, and visualization capabilities. Once this foundation is in place, you may choose to augment the data lake with ISV and SaaS tools.

The deployment also includes an optional wizard and a sample dataset that is loaded into Amazon Redshift and Kinesis streams to demonstrate data lake capabilities.

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying the data lake foundation into a new virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Deploying the data lake foundation into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
